# SMS-Spam-Detection

Hello Everyone!!

This project involves building a spam sms detection system using machine learning and deploying it as a web application with Streamlit. The dataset used for this project is the "spam.csv" dataset, which contains labeled sms classified as spam or ham (non-spam). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify and detect spam sms based on features extracted from the sms content.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Text vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Model training and evaluation (Naive Bayes)
- Streamlit app for email classification
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)

## How to Run the Application:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaishnavi3712/SMS-Spam-Detection
